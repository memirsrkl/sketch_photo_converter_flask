# sketch_photo_converter_flask
Sketch photo created using GAN networks with Python or flask application that converts photo sketch
# ABSTRACT
Today, with the developing machine learning and the developing deep learning algorithms and technologies, the usage areas of this technology in human life have increased at the same rate. This developing technology is used in many areas for the benefit of humanity. One of the studies used for the benefit of humanity is sketch-photo and photo-sketch conversion. In this study, the CycleGAN model is trained for both sketch-photo conversion and photo-sketch conversion. Two different data sets were used for training the model. In the data sets used, there are 57368 images, 50000 sketch images and 7368 color photograph images in total. A website was designed where the trained model is used and image transformation is made.
# For Use
Download the trained models from the specified drive link and put the saved_model.pb files in the working/saved_model/photo_generator and working/saved_model/styled_generator folders.
